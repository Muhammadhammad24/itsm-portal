🚀 ITSM Self-Service Portal – Automating IT Support Workflows

## 📌 Overview
This IT Service Management (ITSM) Self-Service Portal is designed to enhance IT support efficiency and reduce helpdesk workload through automation. The portal allows employees to:
✔ Submit IT support tickets seamlessly
✔ Request a password reset without manual intervention
✔ Track IT issue resolutions in real time

This project demonstrates expertise in helpdesk automation, IT support workflow optimization, and self-service IT solutions, aligning with ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) best practices.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript (User Interface)
- **Backend:** Python Flask (API for ticket management)
- **Database:** SQLite / MySQL (Storing user requests & logs)
- **Security:** Role-based access control (RBAC) & authentication
- **ITIL Framework:** Incident management, change management, and problem resolution
